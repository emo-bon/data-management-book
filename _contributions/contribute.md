## Contributing to the Project

To contribute to this project, you should either fork the repository and create a pull request (PR) with your changes or push your changes to a new branch and create a PR to merge into the main branch.

## How to Get Started

This theme can be used just as other [Jekyll themes][1] and supports [remote theme][12], see [the official guide][13] as well.

You can introduce this Jekyll theme into your own site by either:

- [Fork][3] this repository and add your markdown posts to the `_posts` folder.
- Use as a remote theme in your [`_config.yml`][14] (just like what we do for this site itself),

```yaml
remote_theme: sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook
```

### Deploy Locally with Jekyll Serve

This theme can be run locally using Ruby and Gemfiles.
